# Project-1---Memory-Card-Game
## Initial Purpose
The purpose was to develop a working card game where the user is able to click on two cards to check if they are a match. If those two cards are a match, then they remain revealed until all cards are matched and revealed, at that point which the user wins the game. The bases behind this project game development was also to put lessons taught over the last week into play. I learned to be as resourceful as possible, learned to priorotize, and to maintain the focus of the end goal, a game with the neccessary functionality.

### Brief Collaboration
As I'm sure you know, web development has a lot to do with collaboration. Although this was an individual assignment, it was important to have a brief conversation with someone more exprienced just to discuss the groundwork for project, layout, and whats most important to start with. Here is where it was confirmed to start on the basic coding and game logic before spending time and effort on the CSS. I know how tempting it can be to want to get your web page looking beautiful, but what good is a game that looks great, but has no functionality?
