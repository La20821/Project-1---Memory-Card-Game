# Project-1---Memory-Card-Game
## Initial Purpose
The purpose was to develop a working card game where the user is able to click on two cards to check if they are a match. If those two cards are a match, then they remain revealed until all cards are matched and revealed, at that point which the user wins the game. The bases behind this project game development was also to put lessons taught over the last week into play. I learned to be as resourceful as possible, learned to priorotize, and to maintain the focus of the end goal, a game with the neccessary functionality.
